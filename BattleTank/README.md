# BattleTank
Tank Battle game as part of the Udemy UE4 course

## CONCEPT ##

Battle Tank is a single player game about driving tanks and shooting at other tanks controlled by AI. The game has simple terrain with non-destructible coverm, and the object of the game is to destroy the AI-controlled tank and not get destroyed yourself.

## RULES ##

You win by shooting your opponent until it explodes (health points go to zero), and you lose
when your tank runs out of health points. Both you and the AI can move the tank behind cover
to avoid getting shot. The player (and the enemy tank?) has limited ammunition.

## REQUIREMENTS ##

We need a sound effects for firing, getting hit, moving the tank, and maybe when rotating the turrent.

We need textures for the terrain, and at least one textured model for the tank.
